            <h3>Transformers</h3>
            <p>
                Inspite of evolving game of integration over past 2 decades, all integration platform and products make tranformation of message in the integration context as a key capability. What you may see in Integration product is that you can create a mapper file with drag & drop component, but as the integrations mature overtime, developers keep scripting these mappers and these snippets of mappers are leveraged across multiple integrations that connects the hybrid enterprise ecosystem.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In my experience my SOA implemetations, I have seen developers using XSLT / XQuery as a transformation language where integration developers use XPath to access the XML nodes and uses source and target schemas to constrain the input & outputs. In my prjects with Anypoint Toolset, I have observed muleys leveraging the rich capabilities offered by Dataweave engine which provides access to incoming payload in the form of canonical message constructed with objects, arrays and literal types. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We should also understand that these transformation components offered in Integration layer is somewhat of a higher order capability, and when complemented with services developed with patterns like <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/transfer_object_pattern.htm">Transfer Object, Adapter, Bridge</a> and frameworks developed in software engineering community with language support from Java, we end up building integrated usecases that seamlessly traverse across several integration boundries.

            <h3>Mapper with Simple POJOs</h3>
            <p>
                Let just say we have a person pojo with properties as firstname, lastname and we need a mapper which should return a pojo with name formed with concatenation of firstname and lastname and also return the address that is passed in mapper call.

                    private String firstName;
                    private String lastName;
                
                    Person(String fname, String lname) {
                        this.firstName = fname;
