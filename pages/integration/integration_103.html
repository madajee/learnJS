            <h3>Publish-Subscribe</h3>
            <p>
                One of the traditional ways integrating applications has been with exchanging (send and receive) messages to the central enterprise messaging layer. We generally start with simple terms like Queue (Producer / Consumer and mostly FIFO) or Topic (Multiple Subscribers for different tasks), but there are complexities around guaranteed message delivery, acknowledgements, push vs pull, sequencing & ordering in the messaging layer.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Active MQ & JMS based messaging products implement specifications to provide user friendly interfaces to creates these resources like Queues, Destinations, Topics on an Application Server and server has implementations of connection factories & connection pools and integration developers uses adapters to obtain connection to these messaging servers and implement publish / subscribe interfaces.  
            </p>
            <p>
                As protocols matured and open source languages abstracted the complexity, we now have an ecosystem of messaging platforms like RabbitMQ, Kafka that scales with the cloud. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We also see major cloud providers like AWS, Azure use the open source platforms to provide messaging infrastructure with global scale and pay on the go basis. 
            </p>
            <h3>How doesPublish-Subscribe help ?</h3>
            <p>
                Messaging is an asynchronous enabler for stateless synchronous requests on Http and  users are acknowledged quickly for their actions with a message publisher and subscribers can do the fulfillment, processing and notifications tasks.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Products like Rabbitmq enable configuration driven routing to specific destinations with features like routing-keys.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Platforms like Kafka implement techniques like back-pressure where messages are persisted in order like logs and consumers can playback from a specific point in time.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Messaging has been a way to enable horizontal scaling for a long time, and with cloud enablements you can handle peaks and bursts by creating containers on the fly. 
            </p>
            <h3>Abstractions in Rabbitmq</h3>
            <p>
                vhost / Virtual host - It is the highest level of abstraction with which you enable authentication, authorization and manage user permissions. It can also be used to manage multiple environments in a single instance.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Rabbitmq server is a broker bootstrapped on an erlang node, and allows publisher and subscriber implementations in different languages to connect with a broker using AMQP wire protocol which uses reliable TCP connection.  
            </p>
            <p>
                When the connection is established, multiple channels can be opened over a single connection for parallel data exchange. Channel is another level of abstraction that has to be created before messages can be published and consumed.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike traditional broker architecture, where there is direct binding between the server and resources like queue / or topic, rabbitmq has exchanges and publishers sends messages to the exchange and depending upon the exchange type, routing keys and bindings, messages are delivered to the subscribers.  
            </p>
            <h3>Rabbitmq Publisher - Subscriber Implementation in NodeJS</h3>
            <p>
                In LearnJS-102, we have used node modules like axios and array functions implementations from underscore library to filter some todo records. We are going to piggy-back on that example.  
            </p>
            <p>
                We are going to use docker image to create a rabbit-mq container and have the server listen on default port 5672.  
            </p>
