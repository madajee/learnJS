            <p>
                We all use browsers, but what we may not have realized, at least I did not until I noticed the integration shift which has been my focus area for many years, is that there is a V8 JS Engine that is embedded into the chrome browser application. Some very smart engineers asked each other that we should take the same JS engine, and make it a server side technology, which as per my understanding is NodeJS.
